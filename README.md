General Introduction

Simple Distributed File System is an implementation of a centerless network filesystem with below purposes
  
1. Simple to deployment: as long as Linux system within the network can join to contribute storage spaces to the filesystem 
  
2. High performance(I/O bandwidth and throughputs)
  
3. Robust(one system down should not break whole file system)
